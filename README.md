# python-project

Hey there!

I am Mohamed, an aspiring python developer, and I loooove python so much.
I first wanted to learn Javascript, but it was a bit incoherent to me.
Until the time I encountered python...
I completly fell in love with the language. But, it was kind of hard to learn it on my own, and I have no money to invest in it, and no support from my family.
When I hear about Jetbrain's 1 year free trial on Hack club, I jumped on the opportunity to learn python with the guidance of the organization which created pyCharm!
They thought me how to use Github, and here I am.
Now, I can create a lot of projects thanks to them! And I hope I will learn as much as I can within this year.
